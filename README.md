# Traqueids
Phylogenetic data used in Olson et al. (under review).  

The data provided include the secuence alingment of three plastid regions, the partition scheme and topological constraints used for the ML reconstruction, and the complete list of species used for all analyses. 

The ML trees and dated trees are also provided in the corresponding folders; the treePL folder also includes the configuration file to perform the dating.
All versions of the trees (incl. ML and dated trees) are kept, but the final trees used should always be the latest version:
- v6.* for RaxML files and v6.* for treePL files have a reduced sampling of species of angiosperms and gymnosperms.
- Posterior versions (v6.*.*) have an extended sampling within angiosperms.
The latest version of the dated trees (treePL) was further edited for analysis. Intermediate versions are stored, but only the latest is used for subsequent analyses:
- treePL_Traqueids.v6.2.5.trees

Refer to the list of fossils available at [Virtual Fomration](https://github.com/spiritu-santi/Virtual-Formation) for the calibrarion used for dating:
- AngiospermMember.csv for angiosperm fossils.
- GymnospermMember.csv for gymnopserm fossils.
The calibration codes in treePL's **Configfile.txt** refer to the fossil code provided in both lists (*NFos*).
The angiosperms fossils are described in detail in [Ramírez-Barahona et al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-1241-3)
